# Python Google Cloud Natural Language sample for Google App Engine Flexible Environment

This sample demonstrates how to use the [Google Cloud Natural Language API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/) on [Google App Engine Flexible Environment](https://cloud.google.com/appengine).

## Setup

Create a project with the [Google Cloud Platform Console Cloud Resource Manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager). Make note of your project ID, which may be different than your project name. Make sure to [Enable Billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing?debugUI=DEVELOPERS) for your project.

Enable the Natural Language API. Go to the [Google Cloud Platform console](https://console.cloud.google.com), click the button in the top left, select 'APIs & services', click 'Enable APIs and Services' at the top, search for 'Natural Language', click the first result, then click the 'Enable' button.

Download the [Google Cloud SDK command line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads#interactive), also known as `gcloud`.

Initialize gcloud, selecting your Google account and project ID:

    gcloud init

## Getting the sample code

Run the following command to clone the Github repository:

    git clone https://github.com/ryanmats/gcp-hackathon-demos.git

Change directory to the sample code location:

    cd gcp-hackathon-demos/language

## Authentication

Set up application default credentials:

    gcloud auth application-default login

Set up a service account. Visit the [Google Cloud Platform console](https://console.cloud.google.com), search 'Service Accounts' on the top search bar, click on 'Service accounts', and click the 'Create a Service Account button' towards the top. Give your service account a name and set the 'Role' to Project > Owner. Check the 'Furnish a new private key' box and click 'Create'. Save the generated service account key json file to somewhere on your computer.

Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` variable to point to the service account key location:

    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/service/account/key.json

## Running Locally

Set up your virtual environment:

    virtualenv env

Note: If you do not already have `virtualenv` installed, run 'sudo easy_install pip' and then 'pip install virtualenv'.

Enter your virtual environment:

    source env/bin/activate

Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Test your application locally:

    python main.py

Visit `localhost:8080` to view your application running locally. Press `Control-C` from command line when you are finished.

When you are ready to leave your virtual environment:

    deactivate

## Deploying to App Engine

Deploy your application to App Engine (takes several minutes). When prompted to choose a region, choose the one that is closest to you geographically.

    gcloud app deploy
