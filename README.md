## What's Up?
This is a Google Chrome Extension designed with the primary motivation of fighting against cyber-bullying. Firstly, it is designed to create awareness about the thin line between being friendly and harassing women through digital content that degrade the integrity of woman on social platforms. Also,in a world full of stress, we wish that we erase the negativity offered by the web and  wish to make an effort to bring smile on each individual's face by replacing the offensive contents with an equally humorous words.

We have started incorporating Google's NLP with Sentimental Analysis to understand the user's state of mind and symbolically convert identified offensive words to avoid any collisions.
